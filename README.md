# Video Call App
A one-to-one text, audio and video chat application built with webRTC and Ratchet.

# Requirements
- PHP >= 5.4
- Every other required files are included or referenced as the case may be

# Getting Started
To test this app on your local server:
- The Ratchet server must be ON. This can be achived by navigating to *__video-call-app/ws/bin__* from your cli and run *__php server.php__*
- Run the app from your browser at: `http://localhost/video-call-app/`
- Create and enter a room
- Enter the room from two different browsers (using the same link) and test by sending text chats. This can be done on the same device.
- The audio and video call is best tested on two different devices. This will require more configuration
 - Open `video-call-app/js/comm.js` and change this line `const wsChat = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080/comm");` to `const wsChat = new WebSocket("ws://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/comm");`
 - Open __`video-call-app/ws/bin/server.php`__ and add your server `ip address` to __`$allowed_origins`__ array, then replace the `localhost` in `$app = new Ratchet\App('localhost', 8080, '0.0.0.0');` with your `ip address`
 - Blam! Good to go. Navigate to `YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/video-call-app` on your browser on two different devices to start chatting
- Works best on Chrome, Firefox and the latest versions of Opera desktop browser.


#Note
To host this online, you'll need to set a few things up:
- Create Ratchet as a service so it can run persistently on your server. Check the file *ratchet_as_a_service.txt* for the guide on how to do this on CentOS7
- If on SSL, Ratchet won't work unless you make some changes on your server. This [answer on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16979793/php-ratchet-websocket-ssl-connect) should be helpful.
